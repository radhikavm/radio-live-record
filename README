Requirements
============
- Python 3.x with argparse (which is already included in Python >= 3.2)

Installation
============
- Copy the config file settings.ini into your local settings directory,
  depending on which platform you are using this program, e.g.:
  * Linux: $HOME/.config/radiorec/settings.ini or
  * Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%/radiorec/settings.ini
  or use the commandline option '-s' to specify the location of the
  settings.ini file.
- Adjust the settings to your needs. You can happily add more radio stations
  to the STATIONS section.
  !!! Check at least the the target_dir !!!
- The script file radiorec.py can be placed wherever you want.

Usage
=====
Open a shell and go to the directory where radiorec.py is located.
General usage:
* Windows: py radiorec.py […]
* Linux: python3 radiorec.py […] OR JUST ./radiorec.py […]

What you want to do first is getting some help about how to use the scipt:
./radiorec.py --help
or get some help for the record command:
./radiorec.py record --help

There are two main commands: record and list.

Recording a radio station usually works as follows:
./radiorec.py record <station> <duration> [name]
<station> is the radio station name, for example: dlf
<duration> is how long the recording runs in minutes, for example: 60
[name] is not required and is (currently) just appended to the filename.
Thus the command line is:
./radiorec.py record dlf 60 mytest

You can get a list of all known radio stations with:
./radiorec.py list
You can edit/add the radio stations in the STATIONS section of the settings
file.

Scheduling the recording task
=============================
Using Linux, you can use "at" for scheduling, for example:
at 22:00 friday
> /path/to/radiorec.py record dlf 60 mytest
[CTRL-D]

The recording then starts on the upcoming friday at 10 pm.
Please have a look at the manual page of "at" for more information about
how to schedule your recording tasks.

Known problems
==============
The Windows command line (cmd and powershell) still has problems with UTF-8.
Using the --verbose option might cause the script to crash with an
UnicodeEncodeError. If you want to avoid the crash, you have to do both,
change the command line codepage and the font. For example, doing a
"chcp 65001" and changing the font to "Lucidia Console" should help.
